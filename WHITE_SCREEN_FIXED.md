# Flutter Web Portfolio - White Screen Fix

## Problem Fixed
The white screen issue was caused by improper Flutter initialization and missing proper container setup.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated index.html with Modern Flutter API
- Replaced deprecated `loadEntrypoint` with modern `load` method
- Used proper service worker template token
- Added dedicated app container element
- Improved loading screen with better styling

### 2. Fixed Asset References
- Changed `favicon.png` to `favicon.ico` (actual file that exists)
- Updated manifest.json to use correct favicon
- Fixed manifest colors to match portfolio theme

### 3. Enhanced Loading Screen
- Full-screen loading overlay
- Smooth fade-out transition
- Multiple fallback mechanisms to hide loading
- Better error handling

### 4. Build Optimizations
- Used CanvasKit renderer for better performance
- Enabled tree-shaking for icons (99.5% size reduction)
- Clean build process

## Deployment Steps

1. **Build the app:**
   ```bash
   ./deploy-static-fixed.sh
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   - Copy entire contents of `build/web/` folder
   - Deploy just that folder (not the Flutter source)
   - Vercel will automatically serve index.html

3. **Test locally:**
   ```bash
   cd build/web
   python3 -m http.server 8080
   # Visit http://localhost:8080
   ```

## What Should Work Now
- ✅ No more white screen after loading
- ✅ Smooth loading transition
- ✅ Proper Flutter initialization
- ✅ All navigation and features work
- ✅ Games section with dialogs
- ✅ GitHub links work
- ✅ Responsive design

The portfolio should now load properly on Vercel without any white screen issues!
